# angular-validation-on-domain
A simple directive that allows you to restrict any URLs entered into an input of type="url" to a single domain.  I originally crafted this for use in a form that was intended solely to ingest user-generated videos hosted by YouTube, but this seems like a generic enough problem that someone else might need it.  Share & enjoy!
